title: Autonomous Monitoring & Surveillance Unit
description:  The unit is a fully autonomous, self-contained station that uses drones, cameras, and sensors to monitor remote airstrips for Transport Canada. (I did sign an NDA for this project so I'm limited in how much information I can present).
skills: 
- Structural analysis
- Sheet Metal Forming
- SolidWorks
- Prototyping
- DFM/DFA
- FEA
- GD&T
- Drawings

## My role  
I was the lead mechanical engineer on this project. I worked with the stakeholders to understand requirements and come up with solutions. I owned the SolidWorks models for all the assemblies and parts, and I drafted all the engineering drawings following ASME Y14 standards.
I did not come up with the concepts for the opening bay doors or the solar panels on a telescoping mast, but I helped design them as the stakeholders requested.
I designed a custom telescoping mast with three stages for the solar panels, which can extend to twice its original height, supports a 1.8 kW solar panel array in winds up to 80 km/h and can rotate 360 °and tilt 80° to track the sun.
I ran FEA simulations on the walls, on the solar panel array and the mast that supports it, and on the skid to ensure sufficient safety factors. I designed the mechanisms of all the moving parts, including the

You can put in multiple entries. All images will be at a fixed height in the same row. With smaller window, they will switch to columns.  

### Embeed images
{% include image-gallery.html images="project2.jpg" height="400" %} 
place the images in project folder/images then update the file path.   


## Embedding youtube video
The second video has the autoplay on. copy and paste the 11-digit id found in the url link. <br>
*Example* : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={**MhVw-MHGv4s**}&ab_channel=engineerguy
{% include youtube-video.html id="XpqmTLX5Jws" autoplay= "false"%}


you can also set up custom size by specifying the width (the aspect ratio has been set to 16/9). The default size is 560 pixels x 315 pixels.  

The width of the video below. Regardless of initial width, all the videos is responsive and will fit within the smaller screen.
