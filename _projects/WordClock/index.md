## The clock  
The clock is a stripped down Arduino

## The station
The station is designed to house cameras, drones, and sensors that monitor an outdoor space 24/7 all year round. The station runs on solar power and a backup diesel generator, so all parts had to be optimized for energy usage. The station is designed to operate in weather down to -40° C in remote locations of northern Canada. 

## Challenges and solutions
### Energy Optimization
Whenever possible, moving parts were designed to avoid changing their potential energy across their range of motion. We wanted parts to move perpendicular to gravity and not against gravity.

### Weatherproofing
Using principles from automotive sunroofs, I designed the unit to 

### Side walls
The side walls were especially difficult to design. We made several smaller prototypes for the side walls and a full scale prototype.
