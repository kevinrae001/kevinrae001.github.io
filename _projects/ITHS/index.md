(I signed an NDA for this project so I'm limitted in how much information I can give).
I owned the SolidWorks CAD model, and made all the drawings. I did engineering hand calculations, FEA, sized members and fasteners, made revisions based on feedback from manufacturers, and brought the unit from a concept to a field tested product. I designed the telescoping mast which supports 1.8kW of solar panels, can tilt 80° and can rotate 360° to track the sun. The telescoping mast held up to 80km/h winds during testing. It was tested for two weeks in Suffield, Alberta and successfuly contributed to a $1.5M prize. This unit was a proof of concept so there were many lessons learned, the biggest being:
-1) the mast design needed rework. It rattled in high winds because there was large gaps between the telescoping stages. The wiring was messy and needed fixing on the field.
-2) the walls were too thin and so did not maintain form. They were also misaligned due to poor design on my part.
-3) the unit was not very weatherproof.

These issues were all improved on and resolved in a future iteration.
