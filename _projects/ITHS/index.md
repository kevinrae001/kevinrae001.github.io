I worked on a research system that UBC was doing research on. My role was to build an operational setup for them to perform tests for model characterization and validation. I also worked with UBC grad students to model non-linear, physics based, state space models using MATLAB- Simulink. Some of the tasks I did involve:
- Designed an operational bearing for rotating the solar themal array
- Programmed a motor for the solar thermal array to track the sun throughout the day or rotate on demand
- Installed flow sensors, temperature sensors, solar radiation sensors, and humidity sensors, adding and calibrating Analog-digital converters as needed.
- Troubleshot a broken heat pump, topping up the refridgerant after discovering reduced performace due to a leak.
