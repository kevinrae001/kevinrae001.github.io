> **Note:** I signed an NDA for this project, so the details below are intentionally high-level and limited to what I’m able to share publicly.

## Overview

This project was a **proof-of-concept mobile energy and heating system** intended to reduce fuel usage for relocatable temporary camps by leveraging **solar power** and **waste heat recovery** to support:
- **Warmed air**
- **Heated potable water**

A key subsystem was a **telescoping, sun-tracking mast** supporting the solar array.

## My Role & Contributions

I owned the mechanical engineering design work end-to-end, including:

- Ownership of the **SolidWorks CAD model** and **drawing package**
- **Engineering hand calculations** (members, joints, fasteners)
- **FEA** to validate critical components and loading cases
- Iterating the design based on **manufacturer feedback** (DFM/DFA, fit-up, practicality)
- Supporting integration decisions informed by **PFD/P&ID-level thinking** (interfaces, routing, serviceability)

## Engineering Highlights

### Sun-tracking telescoping mast
- Supported **~1.8 kW** of solar panels
- **Tilt capability:** up to **80°**
- **Rotation:** **360°** for sun-tracking
- Demonstrated survivability in testing up to **~80 km/h winds**

---

## Testing & Outcome

The system was field tested for approximately **two weeks in Suffield, Alberta**, and the proof-of-concept was successful enough to meaningfully contribute to a **$1.5M prize** outcome for the broader effort.

## Key Lessons Learned (from the POC)

1. **Mast tolerance/clearance design**
   - Excess clearance between telescoping stages led to **rattle in high winds**
   - Cabling/wiring approach needed improved routing and strain relief

2. **Sheet metal wall stiffness / form control**
   - Wall thickness and/or reinforcement strategy was insufficient, leading to **form retention issues**
   - Misalignment occurred due to **design decisions that didn’t adequately control datum structure and stack-up**

3. **Weatherproofing**
   - The system required improved sealing, ingress protection strategy, and environmental considerations

These issues were addressed and improved in a subsequent iteration.
