I converted this van into a camper van in 2019 and have had it since then. It is still in excellent condition.

## Highlights
- Solar-powered electrical system for off-grid use
- Built-in kitchen + fridge + storage
- Convertible bed system that transforms into a dinette (and two-table mode)
- High-utility storage under the bed platform
- Added welded brackets to support a removable third middle seat
- Roof ventilation fan for airflow

## Electrical System
The electrical system was designed and built to support off-grid living (charging, distribution, and integration with the van conversion).

## Ventilation

## Seating Modification (Removable Third Middle Seat)
I welded brackets that allowed for adding a third middle seat.

## Convertible Bed → Dinette
Then the bed can be converted to a table and bench:

Or two tables:
