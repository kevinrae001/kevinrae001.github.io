## My role 
(I signed an NDA for this project so I'm limited in how much information I can provide here).

I was the lead mechanical engineer on this project. I worked with the stakeholders to understand requirements and come up with solutions. I owned the SolidWorks models for all the assemblies and parts, and I drafted all the engineering drawings following ASME Y14 standards.
The concepts for the opening bay doors or the solar panels on a telescoping mast are not my own, but I designed them based on input from the stakeholders.
I designed a custom telescoping mast with three stages for the solar panels, which can extend to twice its original height, supports a 1.8 kW solar panel array in winds up to 80 km/h and can rotate 360° and tilt 80° to track the sun.
I ran FEA simulations on the walls, on the solar panel array and the mast that supports it, and on the skid to ensure sufficient safety factors. I did kinematic calculations for the opening bay doors, the solar array and the mast that supports it, and the drone deployment doors.
I ran thermal simulations to optimize heat retention in the unit. 

## The station
The station is designed to house cameras, drones, and sensors that monitor an outdoor space 24/7 all year round. The station runs on solar power and a backup diesel generator, so all parts had to be optimized for energy usage. The station is designed to operate in weather down to -40° C in remote locations of northern Canada. 

## Challenges and solutions
### Energy Optimization
Whenever possible, moving parts were designed to avoid changing their potential energy across their range of motion. We wanted parts to move perpendicular to gravity and not against gravity.

### Weatherproofing
Using principles from automotive sunroofs, I designed the unit to 

### Side walls
The side walls were especially difficult to design. We made several smaller prototypes for the side walls and a full scale prototype.
